# Voting-System-Design-using-Verilog
This project implements a digital voting machine using Verilog HDL, designed with modular architecture and simulation support.
It features:
Debounce logic to filter out noisy button presses.
Vote logging for four candidates.
Mode selection:
Voting Mode: Registers and acknowledges valid votes.
Result Mode: Displays total votes received per candidate via LEDs.
A comprehensive testbench is included to simulate all functional cases: voting, display, reset, and LED feedback.
